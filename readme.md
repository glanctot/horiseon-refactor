# Horizon Refactor

## Description

I received html and css code for the Horiseon company.  The objective was to take the existing code and improve it without changing what the code does.  Horiseon wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

### Changes to Code

- Updated title
- Changed div to header, added nav
- Fixed id's to make nav work
- Added sections, aricles and alt
- Changed div to footer
- Commented css file and consolidated code
